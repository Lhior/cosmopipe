description: Compute odd wide angle effects for the power spectrum
requirements: []

long description: >
                  So far only order n=1 wide angle effects are implemented,
                  but this is just a question of deriving formulae to include more.
                  Relevant only within the context of a :class:`SurveyProjection` pipeline.

options:
  d:
    type: [string, float]
    default: 1.0
    description: distance at the effective redshift. Use :math:`1` if already included in window functions.
                'fiducial' will compute the comoving radial distance at the effective redshift survey_section.zeff.

setup output:
  survey_selection.effect:
    type: PowerOddWideAngle
