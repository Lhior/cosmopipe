                  This pipeline takes care of the different survey selection/geometry effects:
                  (odd) wide-angle, window function, binning...
                  as a suite of matrix operations.
                  The user should just specify the list of modules for these different effects
                  through the keyword $modules.
                  Empty list will result in a simple model evaluation at the data points.
