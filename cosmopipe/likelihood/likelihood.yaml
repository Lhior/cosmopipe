description: Template base likelihood

long description: >
                  :class:`BaseLikelihood` extends :class:`~pypescript.BasePipeline`, hence is expected to run several modules to e.g. setup data and execute model.
                  Data vector data.y is set in the setup step.
                  The model model.y is read at each execute step and the corresponding likelihood.loglkl computed.

setup input:
  data.y:
    type: float_array
    description: data vector

execute input:
  model.y:
    type: float_array
    description: model vector

execute output:
  likelihood.loglkl:
    type: float
    description: log-likelihood

                  Extends :class:`BaseLikelihood` with a calculation for the log-Gaussian likelihood, based on an inverse covariance matrix provided in the setup step.

    description: data vector
  covariance.invcov:
    type: float_array
    description: inverse covariance
  covariance.nobs:

    description: number of observations, to correct for the Hartlap factor. If ``None``, no Harlap correction is applied

description: Sum of several likelihoods

long description: >
                  Extends :class:`BaseLikelihood` to perform the sum of independent log-likelihoods.
                  Inheriting from  :class:`~pypescript.BasePipeline`, it is expected to setup and execute several independent likelihoods;
                  Adds each likelihood.loglkl together.

execute input:
  likelihood.loglkl:
    type: float
    description: peculiar log-likelihood

execute output:

description: Joint Gaussian likelihoods

long description: >
                  Extends :class:`GaussianLikelihood` to join non-independent Gaussian likelihoods.
                  The data.y vectors of each of the input likelihoods (see ``join`` option) are concatenate in the setup step,
                  similarly for the model.y in the execute step. The full inverse covariance matrix should be provided in the setup step
                  (by adding the relevant module to the '#modules' list).

  data.y:
    type: float_array

    description: inverse covariance
